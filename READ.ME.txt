# Running the code in R Studio  #

## Installation 

We performed the following analyses using R Studio (R version 4.2.2) and Spyder Python (version 3.9).

To install:

- R Studio (R version 4.2.2): https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.2.2/ (exe file in the folder)


Follow the instructions on the website to install the sofwares. The installation time should be less than 5 minutes.

## Instruction to run the data in R Studio

1. Open R Studio

2. Click on File (in the tool bar), Open file. It will open a window with folders. Go to the folder where the R script is and click on the R script (Open). Now the script is loaded into the R console.

3. Set up the working directory: Session --> Set Working directory --> Choose Directory, then go to the folder where the input files are and click on Open.

4. Install packages and load them: go the the row where the code includes "install.packages" and "library" and do Ctrl R do load the code.

5. To load each row do Ctrl R.

All analysis and Models are named similarly than in the manuscript.



All datasets used to do the analyses are attached with this file.

All expected run time should be under 5 minutes except for Model 2 (1 hour).

## Reproduction instructions

Information to reproduce the results are present in the section Material and Method of the manuscript.
